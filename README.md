# ðŸ§  AI Analysis Core

This is the core engine that powers the performance test analysis via AI for the **AI Performance Analyzer** platform.

It uses `OpenAI` models (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`) to interpret load test results, extract key insights, and generate recommendations based on input files like `metrics.csv`, `summary.json`, or ZIP bundles.
